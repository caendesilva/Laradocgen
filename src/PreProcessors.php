         * The benchmark ran the function  with a sample file containing
         * the entire ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND by Lewis Carroll,
         * mixed with 100 unique shortcodes randomly shuffled into the text.
         * The entire sample file is 3700 lines long and is over 150kb in size.
         *
         * I ran the function 100 times.
         * In total 370 000 lines were scanned and 10 000 shortcodes were expanded
         *
         * Total execution time for 100 iterations was 4.6932930946 seconds
         * (46.9329309464 MS Avg to scan the entire book).
         * As the execution time is 0.0001ms per line I am pretty happy with the speed.
